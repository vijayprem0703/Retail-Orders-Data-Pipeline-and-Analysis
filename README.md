# Retail-Orders-Data-Pipeline-and-Analysis
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline for retail orders data. The raw dataset was  cleaned by handling missing values and standardizing column names, and transformed to derive key metrics like discounts, sale price, and profit. Finally, the processed data was loaded into SQL Server for storage and analysis.


## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often store their transaction and order data in static formats like CSV/Excel, which limits their ability to perform advanced analytics and reporting. Manual methods (e.g., Excel filtering/sorting) are insufficient for handling large datasets and deriving meaningful insights.
There is a need for a scalable, automated pipeline to:

* Clean and standardize raw retail data.

* Handle missing and inconsistent values.

* Derive key business metrics such as sales, discounts, and profits.

* Load the processed data into a database for further analysis and reporting.


## Project Goals

* Data Ingestion – Download and extract raw retail orders data from Kaggle.

* Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, standardize column names, and convert data types.

* Feature Engineering – Derive important columns such as discount, sale price, and profit.

* Data Transformation – Drop unnecessary columns and prepare data in a structured format.

* Database Integration – Load the cleaned and transformed data into SQL Server for easy access and querying.

* Scalability – Ensure the pipeline can handle incremental/append-based data loading.

## Conclusion

The project successfully built an ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipeline for retail orders data.

- Data was cleaned, transformed, and loaded into SQL Server.

- New metrics like profit were calculated, enabling deeper analysis of business performance.

- The structured database is now ready to be used for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau) or SQL-based analytics.


## Future Steps

- Data Visualization – Connect SQL Server to Power BI/Tableau for building interactive dashboards.

- Automation – Automate the pipeline using Airflow or cron jobs for daily/weekly data refresh.

- Scalability – Extend the pipeline to handle multiple datasets (e.g., customers, products, returns).

- Advanced Analytics – Apply predictive models (e.g., sales forecasting, customer segmentation).
