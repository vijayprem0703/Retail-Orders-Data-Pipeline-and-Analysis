# Retail-Orders-Data-Pipeline-and-Analysis
This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline for retail orders data. The raw dataset was  cleaned by handling missing values and standardizing column names, and transformed to derive key metrics like discounts, sale price, and profit. Finally, the processed data was loaded into SQL Server for storage and analysis.
